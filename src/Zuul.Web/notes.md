https://leastprivilege.com/2016/12/14/optimizing-identity-tokens-for-size/ - when asking for "code id_token" instead of just "id_token", the results are different
- from the logging

Good info on how to get extra fields mapped into the Identity.Claims collection - https://github.com/aspnet/Security/issues/1449
- .AddOpenIdConnect("oidc", options =>
  {
   ...
   options.ClaimActions.MapJsonKey("website", "website", ClaimValueTypes.String);
  }

Some other good info on parsing the results for OpenID stuff - https://github.com/aspnet/Security/issues/1311

things to work on
-- account registration (email verification) - X
-- require email confirmation before logging in - X
-- pull first name (given_name), last name (family_name), full name (name) from db instead of from claims table - X
-- configure role attributes for both MVC and API - X
-- two factor auth with QR code
-- explore endpoints generated by identity server (userinfo, etc)

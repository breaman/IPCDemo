Good info on how to get extra fields mapped into the Identity.Claims collection - https://github.com/aspnet/Security/issues/1449
- .AddOpenIdConnect("oidc", options =>
  {
   ...
   options.ClaimActions.MapJsonKey("website", "website", ClaimValueTypes.String);
  }

Some other good info on parsing the results for OpenID stuff - https://github.com/aspnet/Security/issues/1311
